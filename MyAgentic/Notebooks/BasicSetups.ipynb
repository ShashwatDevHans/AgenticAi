       "'Annotate as you read: What seems significant? What is surprising? Label rhetorical \\nstrategies as you come across them. \\n!\\nPresident Barack Obama (then State Senator) \\nKeynote Address | 2004 Democratic National Convention | Tuesday, July 27, 2004  \\n!\\nLet me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.  \\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let’s face it, my presence on this stage is \\npretty unlikely.  My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in \\nKenya.  He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack.  His father, my \\ngrandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. \\n!\\nBut my grandfather had larger dreams for his son.  Through hard work and perseverance \\nmy father got a scholarship to study in a magical place; America, that shone as a beacon of \\nfreedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.  While studying here, my \\nfather met my mother.  She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas.  \\nHer father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression.  The day after \\nPearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty, joined Patton’s army, marched across \\nEurope.  Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber \\nassembly line.  After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, \\nand later moved west--all the way to Hawaii--in search of opportunity. \\n!\\nAnd they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two \\ncontinents.  My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith \\nin the possibilities of this nation.  They would give me an African name, Barack, or \\n“blessed,” believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.  They \\nimagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren’t rich, because \\nin a generous America you don’t have to be rich to achieve your potential.  They are both \\npassed away now.  And yet, I know that on this night, they look down on me with great \\npride. \\n!\\n[*] They stand here and I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware \\nthat my parents’ dreams live on in my two precious daughters.  I stand here knowing that \\nmy story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came \\nbefore me, and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.  Tonight, we \\ngather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, \\nor the power of our military, or the size of our economy.  Our pride is based on a very \\nsimple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, “We hold \\nthese truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.  That they are endowed by \\ntheir Creator with certain inalienable rights.  That among these are life, liberty and the \\npursuit of happiness.” \\n!\\nThat is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams, an insistence on small \\nmiracles.  That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed \\nand safe from harm.  That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing \\na sudden knock on the door… That we can participate in the political process without fear \\nof retribution, and that our votes will be counted—at least most of the time. \\n!\\nThis year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to \\nhold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our \\nforbearers, and the promise of future generations.  And fellow Americans—Democrats, \\nRepublicans, Independents—I say to you tonight: we have more work to do.  More work \\nto do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the \\nMaytag plant that’s moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own \\nchildren for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour.  More to do for the father that I met who \\nwas losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he would pay $4,500 a \\nmonth for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on.  More to \\ndo for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the \\ngrades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn’t have the money to go to college. \\n!\\n[*] Now don’t get me wrong.  The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners \\nand office parks, they don’t expect government to solve all their problems.  They know \\nthey have to work hard to get ahead and they want to.  Go into the collar counties around \\nChicago, and people will tell you they don’t want their tax money wasted by a welfare \\nagency or by the Pentagon.  Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you \\nthat government alone can’t teach our kids to learn.  They know that parents have to teach, \\nthat children can’t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television \\nsets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.  They \\nknow those things.  People don’t expect government to solve all their problems.  But they \\nsense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure \\nthat every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity'"
