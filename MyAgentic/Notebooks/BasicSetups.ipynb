       "'Annotate as you read: What seems significant? What is surprising? Label rhetorical \\nstrategies as you come across them. \\n!President Barack Obama (then State Senator) \\nKeynote Address | 2004 Democratic National Convention | Tuesday, July 27, 2004  \\n!Let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.  \\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let’s face it, my presence on this stage is \\npretty unlikely.  My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in \\nKenya.  He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack.  His father, my \\ngrandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. \\n!But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son.  Through hard work and perseverance \\nmy father got a scholarship to study in a magical place; America, that shone as a beacon of \\nfreedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.  While studying here, my \\nfather met my mother.  She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas.  \\nHer father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression.  The day after \\nPearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty, joined Patton’s army, marched across \\nEurope.  Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber \\nassembly line.  After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, \\nand later moved west--all the way to Hawaii--in search of opportunity. \\n!And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two \\ncontinents.  My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith \\nin the possibilities of this nation.  They would give me an African name, Barack, or \\n“blessed,” believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.  They \\nimagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren’t rich, because \\nin a generous America you don’t have to be rich to achieve your potential.  They are both \\npassed away now.  And yet, I know that on this night, they look down on me with great \\npride. \\n![*] They stand here and I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware \\nthat my parents’ dreams live on in my two precious daughters.  I stand here knowing that \\nmy story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came \\nbefore me, and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.  Tonight, we \\ngather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, \\nor the power of our military, or the size of our economy.  Our pride is based on a very \\nsimple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, “We hold \\nthese truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.  That they are endowed by \\ntheir Creator with certain inalienable rights.  That among these are life, liberty and the \\npursuit of happiness.” \\n!That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams, an insistence on small \\nmiracles.  That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed \\nand safe from harm.  That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing \\na sudden knock on the door… That we can participate in the political process without fear \\nof retribution, and that our votes will be counted—at least most of the time. \\n!This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to \\nhold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our \\nforbearers, and the promise of future generations.  And fellow Americans—Democrats, \\nRepublicans, Independents—I say to you tonight: we have more work to do.  More work \\nto do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the \\nMaytag plant that’s moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own \\nchildren for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour.  More to do for the father that I met who \\nwas losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he would pay $4,500 a \\nmonth for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on.  More to \\ndo for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the \\ngrades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn’t have the money to go to college. \\n![*] Now don’t get me wrong.  The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners \\nand office parks, they don’t expect government to solve all their problems.  They know \\nthey have to work hard to get ahead and they want to.  Go into the collar counties around \\nChicago, and people will tell you they don’t want their tax money wasted by a welfare \\nagency or by the Pentagon.  Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you \\nthat government alone can’t teach our kids to learn.  They know that parents have to teach, \\nthat children can’t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television \\nsets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.  They \\nknow those things.  People don’t expect government to solve all their problems.  But they \\nsense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure \\nthat every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity'"

       "'‚û°Ô∏è\\uf8ffüß∞‚úÖ\\nHuman psychology is one of the biggest causes of climate change denial. Stress, the\\nfeeling of a lack of control and being detached from the direct effects of a distant danger\\nhave all been shown to encourage dismissive and conspiratorial thinking, which is one of\\nthe key factors that makes people reluctant to accept climate change. In addition,\\nconfirmation bias, or the tendency to trust information that confirms one‚Äôs own views, makes\\nchallenging climate change deniers difficult. However, recent data shows that the majority of\\nthe world‚Äôs population does believe in climate change[7]. This has been conducive to\\nsignificant improvements in climate policy. In fact, as climate change deniers have become\\nless influential and policy progress is being made, the top concern may be whether or not\\nwe can slow warming fast enough.\\nWhile the share of people who don‚Äôt believe in climate change has declined, understanding\\nwhat causes these beliefs is important to addressing complex issues that may arise in the\\nfuture. One major reason for climate change denial is distrust in governments and\\nscientists, which can mean that conspiracy theories about climate change, which often\\ninvolve corrupt scientists and lies by those in power, become much easier for people to\\naccept. A literature review[1] by the American Psychological Association found ‚Äúample\\nevidence‚Äù (p.126) that citizens distrust risk messages from scientists or the government,\\ncausing them to react negatively to advice or policy that they perceive to impinge on their\\nfreedom. Moreover, a study[19] by Goertzel (1994) also found that people who distrusted\\nauthority were more likely to believe in a number of conspiracy theories. Both of these\\nfactors can have worrying implications for the rise of climate change denial in countries with\\nactually corrupt and manipulative governments, such as Russia, where only 43% of citizens\\nconsider climate change a serious threat[20].\\nAnother reason for denial is feeling helpless, which can often make people seek alternative\\nnarratives to regain their sense of control. For example, one study[2] found that residents\\nasked to recall a situation where they didn‚Äôt have control were more likely to believe in\\ncorrupt or untrustworthy actions by their government: one of multiple[3][4] studies linking\\nbelief in conspiracies and feelings of helplessness. Climate change is a complex issue and\\nsolving it is far beyond the control of any single individual, with serious and stressful\\nconsequences. This is exactly the type of problem that is ripe for conspiracy and denial.\\nClimate change denial has also persisted due to confirmation bias. Deniers tend to question\\nor dismiss information that goes against their beliefs and accept evidence that confirms\\nthem. One study[5] by Lijian and Yanmengqian (2021) asked participants, who had\\nanswered whether they believed in climate change or not, to evaluate three videos\\nexpressing different views on climate change before reporting their final attitude on the\\ntopic. The researchers found that people would consider messages that challenged their\\npre-existing beliefs as less effective and their sources as less credible. This pattern of bias\\nwas more often present in deniers, according to the study. These results suggested that,\\nonce exposed to misinformation, the remaining deniers in particular will be very difficult to\\npersuade otherwise.\\nDespite these factors, the vast majority (94%[7] according to the World Economic Forum)\\nof the world population do believe that climate change exists. A study by the UNDP[8]\\nfound that 64% of people consider climate change an emergency. This number also\\nappears to be on an upwards trend; Pew research has found a general increase in\\nconcern about climate change among citizens of ‚Äòadvanced economies‚Äô (except japan)[9]\\nand Yale surveys showing an 8% increase in Americans believing in climate change,\\nfrom 64% in 2014[10] to 72% in 2020[6], with a significant portion of the rest answering\\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know‚Äù (16% in 2020[6]) rather than ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.\\nFurthermore, world leaders are finally showing greater resolve to take meaningful action\\nto stop climate change, as illustrated by the Kyoto Protocol (192 countries)[11] and Paris\\nAgreement (196 countries in 2015)[12], with these and subsequent national and\\ninternational climate policies nearly halving predictions for temperature rise (see\\ngraph[13] below). Recent COP conferences\\nhave also improved these predictions, with\\nthe outcome of COP26 leading to a reduction\\nin global warming estimates from 2.7‚ÑÉ to\\n2.4‚ÑÉ, according to UCL[14].\\nIt may seem unusual to take an optimistic view\\non climate change, but trends in global public\\nopinion and in policy seem to be positive.\\nWhile there is still important debate going on\\nabout whether governments and companies\\nare moving fast enough, the influence of\\nclimate change deniers seems to be fading.\\nWhile this sounds cautiously optimistic, the climate situation overall is still worrying. Even\\ncurrent pledges and targets are unlikely to prevent a temperature rise of less than 2‚ÑÉ[13],\\nwith actions needed to keep the rise below 1.5¬∞C described as ‚Äúvery ambitious‚Äù by the\\nIPCC[17]\\nif not entirely ‚Äúimplausible‚Äù[18] by others, suggesting that the monumental efforts and\\nspending required to achieve ‚Äúnet zero by 2050[17]‚Äù might be greater than those needed to\\nmanage the effects of a 2-2.4¬∞C temperature rise. Taking into account the IPCC prediction\\nthat a global temperature rise of 2¬∞C instead of 1.5¬∞C could result in around 420 million\\nmore people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves [15] and, according to AMAP,\\n‚Äúthe probability of an ice-free Arctic summer is 10 times greater under a 2¬∞C global warming\\nscenario compared with a 1.5¬∞C scenario[16]‚Äù; one of the countless devastating effects such\\na change will likely have on ecosystems around the world.\\nFinding ways to minimise these impacts is urgently important, as a growing number of\\npeople recognise. While climate change conspiracies and denial rooted in human\\npsychology will never completely disappear, the actual influence of this group of people is\\nshrinking. While progress to limit climate change is accelerating, the situation remains very\\ndangerous and the greatest priority should be working with politicians and businesses to\\nlower emissions as quickly as possible, because every 0.5¬∞C increase can have serious\\neffects and our time to act is running out.'"
