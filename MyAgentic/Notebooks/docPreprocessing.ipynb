       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\Workstation\\\\AGenticAI\\\\MyAgentic\\\\Notebooks\\\\..\\\\..\\\\Data\\\\ClimateChange.txt'}, page_content='Human psychology is one of the biggest causes of climate change denial. Stress, the\\nfeeling of a lack of control and being detached from the direct effects of a distant danger\\nhave all been shown to encourage dismissive and conspiratorial thinking, which is one of\\nthe key factors that makes people reluctant to accept climate change. In addition,\\nconfirmation bias, or the tendency to trust information that confirms one’s own views, makes\\nchallenging climate change deniers difficult. However, recent data shows that the majority of\\nthe world’s population does believe in climate change[7]. This has been conducive to\\nsignificant improvements in climate policy. In fact, as climate change deniers have become\\nless influential and policy progress is being made, the top concern may be whether or not\\nwe can slow warming fast enough.\\nWhile the share of people who don’t believe in climate change has declined, understanding\\nwhat causes these beliefs is important to addressing complex issues that may arise in the\\nfuture. One major reason for climate change denial is distrust in governments and\\nscientists, which can mean that conspiracy theories about climate change, which often\\ninvolve corrupt scientists and lies by those in power, become much easier for people to\\naccept. A literature review[1] by the American Psychological Association found “ample\\nevidence” (p.126) that citizens distrust risk messages from scientists or the government,\\ncausing them to react negatively to advice or policy that they perceive to impinge on their\\nfreedom. Moreover, a study[19] by Goertzel (1994) also found that people who distrusted\\nauthority were more likely to believe in a number of conspiracy theories. Both of these\\nfactors can have worrying implications for the rise of climate change denial in countries with\\nactually corrupt and manipulative governments, such as Russia, where only 43% of citizens\\nconsider climate change a serious threat[20].\\nAnother reason for denial is feeling helpless, which can often make people seek alternative\\nnarratives to regain their sense of control. For example, one study[2] found that residents\\nasked to recall a situation where they didn’t have control were more likely to believe in\\ncorrupt or untrustworthy actions by their government: one of multiple[3][4] studies linking\\nbelief in conspiracies and feelings of helplessness. Climate change is a complex issue and\\nsolving it is far beyond the control of any single individual, with serious and stressful\\nconsequences. This is exactly the type of problem that is ripe for conspiracy and denial.\\nClimate change denial has also persisted due to confirmation bias. Deniers tend to question\\nor dismiss information that goes against their beliefs and accept evidence that confirms\\nthem. One study[5] by Lijian and Yanmengqian (2021) asked participants, who had\\nanswered whether they believed in climate change or not, to evaluate three videos\\nexpressing different views on climate change before reporting their final attitude on the\\ntopic. The researchers found that people would consider messages that challenged their\\npre-existing beliefs as less effective and their sources as less credible. This pattern of bias\\nwas more often present in deniers, according to the study. These results suggested that,\\nonce exposed to misinformation, the remaining deniers in particular will be very difficult to\\npersuade otherwise.\\nDespite these factors, the vast majority (94%[7] according to the World Economic Forum)\\nof the world population do believe that climate change exists. A study by the UNDP[8]\\nfound that 64% of people consider climate change an emergency. This number also\\nappears to be on an upwards trend; Pew research has found a general increase in\\nconcern about climate change among citizens of ‘advanced economies’ (except japan)[9]\\nand Yale surveys showing an 8% increase in Americans believing in climate change,\\nfrom 64% in 2014[10] to 72% in 2020[6], with a significant portion of the rest answering'),\n",

Recent COP conferences\\nhave also improved these predictions, with\\nthe outcome of COP26 leading to a reduction\\nin global warming estimates from 2.7℃ to\\n2.4℃, according to UCL[14].\\nIt may seem unusual to take an optimistic view\\non climate change, but trends in global public\\nopinion and in policy seem to be positive.\\nWhile there is still important debate going on\\nabout whether governments and companies\\nare moving fast enough, the influence of\\nclimate change deniers seems to be fading.\\nWhile this sounds cautiously optimistic, the climate situation overall is still worrying. Even\\ncurrent pledges and targets are unlikely to prevent a temperature rise of less than 2℃[13],\\nwith actions needed to keep the rise below 1.5°C described as “very ambitious” by the\\nIPCC[17]\\nif not entirely “implausible”[18] by others, suggesting that the monumental efforts and\\nspending required to achieve “net zero by 2050[17]” might be greater than those needed to\\nmanage the effects of a 2-2.4°C temperature rise. Taking into account the IPCC prediction\\nthat a global temperature rise of 2°C instead of 1.5°C could result in around 420 million\\nmore people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves [15] and, according to AMAP,\\n“the probability of an ice-free Arctic summer is 10 times greater under a 2°C global warming\\nscenario compared with a 1.5°C scenario[16]”; one of the countless devastating effects such\\na change will likely have on ecosystems around the world.\\nFinding ways to minimise these impacts is urgently important, as a growing number of\\npeople recognise. While climate change conspiracies and denial rooted in human\\npsychology will never completely disappear, the actual influence of this group of people is\\nshrinking. While progress to limit climate change is accelerating, the situation remains very\\ndangerous and the greatest priority should be working with politicians and businesses to\\nlower emissions as quickly as possible, because every 0.5°C increase can have serious\\neffects and our time to act is running out.')]"
